# Using This MCP Server with Jan AI

Author: Prompted by SophieA; Generated by Claude Sonnet 4.6; 

This guide assumes:

* You already have **Jan AI installed** → [https://jan.ai](https://jan.ai)
* You are using a model that supports **MCP (wrench icon)**
* You have received an **OUTLINE_API_KEY from your admin**

Note: This guide was written using macOS. Paths, commands, and environment variable setup may differ slightly on Linux. Adjust accordingly.


## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/10xdeca/mcp-servers
cd mcp-servers
```

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for both Kan and Outline MCP servers.

## 3️⃣ Verify the Outline MCP Server Works

Run it manually once:

```bash
OUTLINE_API_KEY=your_key node packages/outline/index.js
```

If:

* It does **not** throw an error
* It just sits there running

That means it started correctly.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

If there are no errors, Jan AI will be able to connect to it.


# 4️⃣ Add MCP Server in Jan AI

Open **Jan AI**.

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Go to **MCP Servers**
3. Click **Add MCP Server**

## Fill the Modal Like This

* **Server Name:** `Outline xdeca`
* **Transport Type:** `STDIO`
* **Command:** `node`
* **Arguments:**

```
/Users/taro/projects/mcp/sprints-xdeca-mcp/packages/outline/index.js
```

⚠️ Must be the full absolute path (no `~`).

* **Environment Variables:**

```
OUTLINE_API_KEY = your_key_from_admin
```

Then toggle the server **ON**.

## Alternative: Add via JSON

At the top right of the **Add MCP Server** modal, click:

> **Add server by JSON**

Paste:

```json
{
  "Outline xdeca": {
    "active": true,
    "args": [
      "/Users/you-user/mcp-servers/packages/outline/index.js"
    ],
    "command": "node",
    "env": {
      "OUTLINE_API_KEY": "your_key_here"
    },
    "type": "stdio"
  }
}
```

Save.

Sophie note:

At this point the Outline MCP server should toggle green. If it does not toggle green, on JanAI go to "Settings > General > Open Logs" to start debugging.

If it does toggle green, you can use it as is or you can create a new assistant for better results:


# 5️⃣ Create a Dedicated Outline Assistant

To make usage cleaner, create a new assistant in Jan:

1. Go to **Settings → Assistants**
2. Click **Create Assistant**
3. Name it: `Outline Assistant`
4. Select your MCP-capable model (must show the 🔧 wrench icon)
5. Paste your instructions from:

```
janai-mcp-outline-prompt.md
```

into the **System Instructions** field.

Save.


# 6️⃣ Use It

Now you can ask things like:

* “Search for onboarding docs”
* “Create a new document in Engineering collection”
* “Update the sprint planning document”
* Upload an image and ask it to create notes

The assistant will automatically call the Outline MCP tools.

---

That’s it. You now have a fully local Outline MCP integration running inside Jan AI.
